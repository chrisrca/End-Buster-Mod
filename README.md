# End Buster Mod

The minecraft End Buster Mod simulates the generation of the minecraft end dimension using [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes/tree/ae58fc49833db481ae493015ddffce317f1ace9b). This data is then used to show you waypoints to the nearest end cities as well as indicating whether they have a ship or not.

## Usage

Use ```/setseed <seed>``` to set the world seed used for generation. This seed is saved across instances so you do not need to enter this command every time you launch minecraft.
Visited End Cities are stored in a file by seed, hiding them if you have already visited them.
